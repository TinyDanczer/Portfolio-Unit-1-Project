            <h2>Reading</h2>
            <p>AA picture of most of the books I own. I mostly read fantasy and some paranormal. I also love informational articles or books about animals and genetics. 
                I find it all rather intriguing. However, most days I'm really just looking for a book to truly pull me away from reality. 
                I used to read all through kindergarten and middle school. I was the kid who would spend recess reading. Coming into high school it sorta fell off for me. 
                The three original authors that really got me back into reading as a teen were Sarah J. Maas, Leigh Bardugo, and Marie Lu. 
                These three were big for me in my high school years, and I still love picking up any book written by them. 
                New Authors I have become entirely obsessed with due to their writing style would be V.E. Schwab, Margaret Rogerson, and Jennifer Hartman. 
                I love a book that writes so beautifully it captures. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Gaming</h2>
            <P>Gaming has been a part of my life since I can remember. It goes all the way back to a Nintendo NES and Duck Hunter. I remember blowing out the cartridges. 
                It only evolved from there to PlayStation, Xbox, GameCube, and even Pc. My earliest PC days bring me back to time well spent with my Grandma. 
                My PC days started with a horse browser game called Hworse that I still check in on every now and then. 
                It was this game and wow, World of Warcraft, that filled my earliest memories of gaming. Believe it or not, it was my grandma who introduced my siblings and me to the game. 
                Now I have ventured into my own preferences that lean a lot more into the simulation genre of gaming. 
                I still love a good MMO RPG, but I don't have the time like I used to truly enjoy them. 
                So instead I spend a lot of time on single-player sim games like Planet Zoo, and Ranch of Rivershine. T
                hese are only two of my current favorites. I also enjoy an indie game known as Horse Isles 3, but I have found it hard to put some time back into this game as well. 
                Other Games I've enjoyed are Ark Survival Evolved, Destiny 2, RDR 1 and 2, and Rival Stars Horse Racing. The current games I am following as they develop are Astride, That Horse Game, and Light No Fire.
            </P>

            <h2>Writing</h2>
            <p>I love reading a good story as much as I enjoy writing my own. I do not write professionally, and this is simply something I invest my time into for myself, or close friends and family. 
                However, putting words to paper is such a joy for me. Developing new worlds from the bare bones and fleshing them out is so much fun. 
                Developing magic systems and sometimes even newish races. Developing unique religions, and really all the different bits and pieces that make up a world far away from this one has always been something I've enjoyed. 
                Beyond building worlds. I love fleshing out and making characters to exist within these worlds. The problems they face and how they conquer them. 
                I've been telling stories ever since I was little or so my mom tells me. My nickname Sissy Lala stems from this; because I simply spend a lot of my time in "la la land". 
                In ways, I think I love to live among the clouds and away from reality in a lot of my hobbies. I enjoy the smaller things in life, but fantasy worlds tend to be far more exciting. 
                They capture my attention, and often I can drift among them for hours lost in my thoughts.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Family Time</h2>
            <p>For all the adventuring I do through words and games. I lead a simple life. My simple life is often filled with a vast amount of time with my family. 
                Whether it be snuggling with my little one or significant other or chatting about books with my sister or significant other. I enjoy every minute. 
                I am very lucky to have such a tight-knit family. Typically once a week my siblings and I get together for game night. Drinks, snacks, and gaming...What more could you want? 
                We play games like DND, Mario smashBros, Overcooked, and others. We recently have gotten into ordering tabletop games from Game Found to expand on this. 
                I can not wait to sit back with some wine and try out these new games. I really do a lot with my family even though I'm older. 
                Oftentimes times any adventure I am going on part my family is attending. Whether it be just my son, and significant other, my siblings, or mom. 
                It is almost always a family affair, and I wouldn't trade it for anything. We are constantly making memories that'll last.
