            <h2>Amazon</h2>
                <p>This was my most recent job. I worked as stower. Essentially I spent my day stocking items into pods that were brought to me on little robots. It wasn't an awful job.
                    However, I wouldn't say it was anything great. It paid well, and had good benefits. I worked for Amazon I believe for a little over a year. I ended up pregnant and ended up taking maternity leave.
                    Amazon's maternity and paternal leave policies are actually very good compared to other companies, so I lucked out. After my 20 weeks of paid leave, I resigned and am now staying home with my son. 
                    My signifcant other, and I agreed we wnated him to atleast one present parent. Plus childcare can be costly, and I haven't missed one milestone.</p>
                <br>
            <h2>Pet Paradise</h2>
                <p>I orginally started at Pet Paradise as a Kennel Tech during peak season which is around the holidays. Pet Paradise is a cat and dog boarding, and daycare facility, that also offers grooming. 
                    I throughly loved this job. Although it was hard work for little pay. I spent a good portion of my shift cleaning kennels, and play yards, and feeding dogs. 
                    However, when that was all done I would spend the rest of my shift running dogs and doing playtimes. I ran into dogs of all kinds. Old, small, large, young, friendly, and even aggressive. 
                    It was very important to be aware of a dog's body language. I ended up resigning the first time due to hours being cut and no longer being able to cover my bills. I left on good terms.
                    Fast forward a bit, and I reached back out for rehire once I decided to take up dog grooming. I worked, and interned at this time to gain experince. I also worked as a dog groomer on the side.
                    Ultimately I ended up not enjoying the grooming as much as I'd hoped. Dogs can be aggressive, and the time constraints with expected quality for groomers at times felt unrealistic. 
                    I still use the skills I have learned, but I no longer use them for income. </p>
                <br>
            <h2>Nursing/Dietary Aid</h2>
                <P>This third one is sort of a mix. I worked at a few different nursing homes. My initial foot in this career path was a dietary aid. 
                    I essentially served trays, did dishes, and prepared drinks. It was vital to read the resident's food restrictions or types. 
                    Such as some needing thickened liquids, or having allergies. The pay wasn't good, but the hours were. I mostly didn't mind this job, but I didn't see much of a future in it. 
                    I resigned from this specific nursing home because the building had flooded for a second time, and ended up being shut down. They opened a new one named Heights on Valley Ranch.
                     However, before I started working here I worked at another facility in a different town. I worked both as a CNA, and Dietary cook at this one. 
                     I loved this specific nursing home. We had around 12 residents, and 3 aids in the large home. I grew very attached to a lot of the residents within this nursing home since it was smaller and more personable. 
                     I ended up moving, and could no longer manage a one-hour commute one way to work. I then started working at Heights of Valley Ranch. I got hired on as an Aide/cook, which means this time I would cook and prepare the actual meals. 
                     I didn't mind this job much either, and it paid better this time around. However, I had a few sexual harassment incidents with a co-worker. 
                     Between HR and management, they did not take any action. So I quit.</P>
                <br>
            <h2>TacoBell</h2>
                <p>I could say so much about my time spent working for TacoBell. I think it will always have a place in my heart, or perhaps it's the people I met while working there.
                     I worked at a total of three different Taco Bells over a span of 4 years...maybe 5. This was my first job at the age of 15. 
                     It paid minimum wage but as a teen, it put money in my pocket and helped me learn my first lessons in paying some bills. 
                     Just like all three Taco Bells I worked at my crew here became some of my closest friends at the time. 
                     I even would work out and have lunch with the assistant manager. Unfortunately 8 months into the job we moved from Idaho to Texas, and I had to resign. 
                     You guessed it though my second job in Texas was a TacoBell. Out of all three of the Tacobells I worked for I spent the least amount of time at this one and didn't bond with the crew as much. 
                     However, It was still a job I was familiar with and once again gave me some money. I ended up transferring from this TacoBell to another after we moved to a different city. 
                     This third TacoBell I spent the most time at, and became very close with several of the crew members. I also achieved the most growth at this one. 
                     After years of experience, I finally accepted being trained up to become a manager. I was the second youngest on the crew, and earning the respect of my fellow team members was hard-earned. 
                     No 30-year-old wants a barely 20-year-old telling them what to do. I had a bit of a rough start in this aspect, but I always put in as much work as I asked of my team. 
                     It didn't take long for my team to look forward to working on my shifts, or at least most. Some people just don't want to work. 
                     Shortly after becoming a team lead, I was being trained to become an assistant manager. I started taking on other responsibilities such as truck orders etc. 
                     Despite how much I LOVED working here, and the work family I made. I knew TacoBell was not where I wanted to spend my life. 
                     Before I officially stepped up and became fully trained as an assistant manager I resigned and traveled down new paths in search of a different career. </p>
